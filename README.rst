This bot is used to run a server under an IRC called Discord. With this bot, you can match users one one one within the IRC and get people to conversate with one another.
Matching users one on one on discord allows for people to make friends much easier as it's less awkward than joining a server with everyone spamming and knowing each other.
This is the discord link to an example of the bot. Currently looking for people to help around and make this thing work out. 

A little bit of history on this bot. I originally worked on this bot in december of 2020, and ran a server it obtained over 1500 users in about one or two weeks with little functionality. The bot had a lot of bugs here and there and it was very hard to upkeep a large userbase, and along with personal issues, I shut it down.  This was inspired by the addition to an LFG feature that discord added in the winter of 2017, which discord 100% removed and never came back to.

I personally made a lot of friends through discord/lfg, and I hope to make this something special and unique allowing for people to make friends and meet people.
