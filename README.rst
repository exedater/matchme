This bot is used to run a server under an IRC called Discord. With this bot, you can match users one one one within the IRC and get people to conversate with one another.
Matching users one on one on discord allows for people to make friends much easier as it's less awkward than joining a server with everyone spamming and knowing each other.
This is the discord link to an example of the bot. Currently looking for people to help around and make this thing work out.
